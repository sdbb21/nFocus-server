# nFocus - A nBack based game

## Introduction

nFocus is a memory game based on the Double [n-Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n-back) performance task where the player is exposed in each round to a Visual and an Auditory stimulus at the same time. During each round, the player shall identify if one or both of these stimuli appeared in a n quantity of rounds before.
The objective of nFocus is to provide the player an opportunity to use its concentration capacity, its [Working Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory) and [Fluid Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence) through a playful and competitive experience.
